# GraphQL Mesh Testing

Collection of tests for different packages and functionalities provided by the GraphQL Mesh framework.

The motivation behind this project is to provide a testing environment for conducting tests or proofs of concept of the features provided by the GraphQL Mesh module.
This will facilitate understanding how thee features work and also aid in the reproduction of potential issues, which could then be shared with the module's maintainers via sandbox tooling.

### Test cases

- [Mesh Config](./packages/config/README.md)
- [OpenAPI loader](./packages/loaders/openapi/README.md)
